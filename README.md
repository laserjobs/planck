# The D₄ Lattice Standard Model: Analytic Closure

This repository contains the executable proof that the parameters of the Standard Model ($\alpha_s$, $\sin^2\theta_W$, $\mu$, etc.) are not arbitrary, but are rigorously derived from the geometric and spectral properties of the D₄ lattice.

The theory eliminates all 26 free parameters of the Standard Model by demonstrating that they are fixed by a single mathematical theorem: the spectral zeta function of the D₄ lattice, $Z_{D_4}(3)$.
